There are a couple of posts, articles and papers that I really enjoyed:

- **[How to read a code](https://www.iamjonas.me/2020/08/how-to-read-code.html)** - a wonderful article about
    how to jump into a large codebase with confidence. It starts from describing some bits of the learning
    theory and walks through a practical example of reading code. It reminds me of [A Mind For Numbers book](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/)
    (which I highly recommend) and is a great inspiration. I don't agree with all the points 
    (writing/drawing a complex system would take ages!) but it's still worth a read.

- **[Reasons why bugs might feel "impossible"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/06/08/reasons-why-bugs-might-feel-impossible/)** - A great summary of what comes into tacking down difficult bugs.
    I treat is mostly as a very helpful checklist I go back to when my morale go down because of an issue
    that's "impossible" to fix. Don't forget to check out [her zines](https://wizardzines.com/), they are awesome!
