There are a couple of posts, articles and papers that I enjoyed and wanted to share:

- **[How to read a code](https://www.iamjonas.me/2020/08/how-to-read-code.html)** - a great article about
    how to jump into a large codebase with confidence. It first describes some learning
    theory and walks through a practical example of reading code. It reminds me of [A Mind For Numbers book](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/)
    (also recommended) and is a great inspiration. I don't agree with all the points but it's still worth a read.

- **[Reasons why bugs might feel "impossible"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/06/08/reasons-why-bugs-might-feel-impossible/)** -
  a great summary of what comes into tracking down difficult bugs. Don't forget to check out [her zines](https://wizardzines.com/), they are awesome!

- **[How I found a bug in Intel Skylake processors](http://gallium.inria.fr/blog/intel-skylake-bug/)** -
  on the topic of impossible bugs. A clear and detailed write-up of debugging an issue that turned out to be
  a hardware bug. Quite an exciting story!

- **[Organizational Skills Beat Algorithmic Wizardry](https://prog21.dadgum.com/177.html)** -
  I completely agree with this blog post. It's possible to survive and do a good work as a programmer
  if you can arrange and organize things. I'm the walking proof of this!
