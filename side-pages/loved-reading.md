There are a couple of posts, articles and papers that I enjoyed and wanted to share:

- **[How to read a code](https://www.iamjonas.me/2020/08/how-to-read-code.html)** - a great article about
    how to jump into a large codebase with confidence. It first describes some learning
    theory and walks through a practical example of reading code. It reminds me of [A Mind For Numbers book](https://barbaraoakley.com/books/a-mind-for-numbers/)
    (also recommended) and is a great inspiration. I don't agree with all the points but it's still worth a read.

- **[Reasons why bugs might feel "impossible"](https://jvns.ca/blog/2021/06/08/reasons-why-bugs-might-feel-impossible/)** - A great summary of what comes into tracking down difficult bugs.
    Don't forget to check out [her zines](https://wizardzines.com/), they are awesome!
