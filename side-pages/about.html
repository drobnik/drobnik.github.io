      Hi, my name is <b>Karolina</b> and I dip my toes into many computer topics on daily basics. Don't be surprised if you see
      reverse engineering binaries, looking at operating systems and then rumbling about Railsy stuff.
    </p>

      This is my personal space where you can find my notes on things I decided to dissect or general software engineering practices. 
      You can expect my posts to look 
      <a href="https://engineering.freeagent.com/2021/06/10/titlecase-underscore-and-laser-guns/">something like this</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy playing video and tabletop games, baking plant-based cakes, (hill-)walking 
      and generally staying active. Give me a shout if you need a climbing partner!
