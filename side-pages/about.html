      Hi, my name is <b>Karolina</b> and this is my personal space where I ramble mostly about Linux
      stuff. The blog started with my Outreachy internship and posts on memblock, but I had
      episodes of writing things up
      <a href="https://engineering.freeagent.com/2021/06/10/titlecase-underscore-and-laser-guns/">
        before</a>, and I really enjoy doing it.
    </p>

    <p>
      I moved on from Memory Management subsystem and fell into DRM and kernel mode drivers,
      about which I'm still learning (and will keep learning for the next couple of years!).
      Apart from that, I enjoy peeking under the hood of different systems and frameworks,
      reverse engineer binaries and messing up with graphics.
    </p>

    <p>
      In my spare time, I enjoy playing video and tabletop games, baking plant-based cakes, (hill-)walking,
      running and generally staying active.
